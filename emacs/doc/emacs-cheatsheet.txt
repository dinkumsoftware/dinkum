# tramp
# A way to edit remote files and files owned by root
# https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode
Find File: /ssh:<username>@<host>:<filename>    # edits file remotely
           ^              ^      ^

# Edits local as root
Find File: /sudo::/path/to/file-to-edit

# Edit remote file as root
Find File: /ssh:you@remotehost|sudo:remotehost:/path/to/file

# Launch emacs from unity(and maybe gnome)
# At least on Ubuntu 14.04, if you launch emacs from desktop button, it
# doesn't read .bashrc, instead reading .profile.
# To fix that add to .emacs.d/<somewhere>
    (setq shell-file-name "bash")
    (setq shell-command-switch "-ic")
# That still does make (compile) ^X^E read .bashrc
# Only workaround I found is:
    ^X^E
    Compile Command: bash -ic <desired command>

# If you launch it from a terminal, it dies when terminal is killed
# This launches it from a terminal and disowns it so emacs is not killed
# when terminal is killed.
    emacs &
    [1] 10480    ; job# and process id
    disown %1    ; where 1 is the job number.

# Tag commands that work in version 25
# M == <esc>
M-.’       (‘xref-find-definitions’) – find a tag, that is, use a tags file to look up a definition.
           If the backend returns multiple hits with the same name, a window will pop up showing all the hits,
           use ‘n’ and ‘p’ to navigate and press ‘RET’ to jump to a particular match.

`C-x 4 .’  (‘xref-find-definitions-other-window’) – select the buffer containing a tag’s definition in another window,
           and move point there.

`M-,’      (‘xref-pop-marker-stack’) – jump back
`C-M-.’    (‘xref-find-apropos’) – find all meaningful symbols that match a regexp or word list
`M-?’      (‘xref-find-references’) – find all references to the identifier at point

# Get line numbers to display on left side of buffer
# From https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers
In emacs ver 26+
    alt-x [global]-display-linenumbers-mode  # global    => every buffer
                                             # otherwise => just this buffer

For older emacs:
    M-x linum-mode  # For current buffer only
