# Launch emacs from unity(and maybe gnome)
# At least on Ubuntu 14.04, if you launch emacs from desktop button, it
# doesn't read .bashrc, instead reading .profile.
# If you launch it from a terminal, it dies when terminal is killed
# This launches it from a terminal and disowns it so emacs is not killed
# when terminal is killed.
