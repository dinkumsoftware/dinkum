**** To change who can sudo and what they do:
1) Put a file in /etc/sudoers.d
2) filename can't have a "." in it or end with '~', else
   it is silently ignored.
3) It's permission: -r--r-----     i.e. chmod 440  <filename>

# Let <user> do anything without a password
# have /etc/sudoers.d/<somefile> contain:
<user> ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL


**** If you get HOSED...
if you have a parse error in /etc/sudoers.d/whatever

It won't let you sudo, which you need to fix the problem.
One could reboot in single user mode and delete the file, but

supplies a nice fix:
    pxexec emacs   # or whatever editor you want
