Trying to allow remote X access.

Things you have to do:
   gdmsetup
       Enable XDMCP
       Security: uncheck disallow TCP connections
   /etc/hosts.allow:
       gdm: 172.16.63.0/255.255.255.0
   xhost + hostname
   firewall down (or open to 177)

   things I thought I had to do but didn't:
       /etc/inittab remove -nodaeamon from 5:respawn line
