A desciption of DNS setup and tools.

This describes:
    Ubuntu 18.4.04 Desktop version

As shipped there is a local cached dns server:
    /lib/systemd/systemd-resolved
NetManager (via Setting gui) controls individual interfaces:
    I THINK this is:
       /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-network --spawner :1.22 /org/gtk/gvfs/exec_spaw/3

Config files:
    As shipped:
    /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
        nameserver 127.0.0.53
        options edns0
        search hsd1.ma.comcast.net

    /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
    All commented out, but a place to make changes.
    You need to make systemd-resolve reread after changes. See Tools
        # DNS=
        #FallbackDNS=
        #Domains=
        #LLMNR=no
        #MulticastDNS=no
        #DNSSEC=no
        #Cache=yes
        #DNSStubListener=yes

    NetworkManager (via settings gui) controls the interfaces.
    It appears you have to turn interface off/on for changes to take effect.

    Other choices if you want to diddle stuff:
    /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf:
        nameserver 10.23.4.1      #[ed. note] from dhcp via wifi Netmanager controlled iface
        nameserver 75.75.75.75    #[ed. note] from dhcp ethernet Netmanager controlled iface
        nameserver 75.75.76.76    #[ed. note]           ditto
        # Too many DNS servers configured, the following entries may be ignored.
        nameserver 2001:558:feed::1
        nameserver 2001:558:feed::2
        search hsd1.ma.comcast.net

        /etc/systemd/network/*.network files     the per-link static settings
        

Tools:
    systemctl --help <snips>
        NOTE: This seems to make systemd-resolve reread it's config with out stop/start or restart
        sudo systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolve.service Reload one or more units if possible,
                                                                 otherwise start or restart

        sudo systemctl start             systemd-resolve.service Start (activate) one or more units
        sudo systemctl stop              systemd-resolve.service Stop (deactivate) one or more units
        sudo systemctl restart           systemd-resolve.service Start or restart one or more units
        sudo systemctl try-restart       systemd-resolve.service Restart one or more units if active
        sudo systemctl try-reload-or-restart systemd-resolve.service   If active, reload one or more units,
                                                                       if supported, otherwise restart

        sudo systemctl list-units
        sudo systemctl list-sockets

        DON'T WORK:
        sudo systemctl reload            systemd-resolve.service Reload one or more units
        ==> Failed to reload systemd-resolved.service:
        ==> Job type reload is not applicable for unit systemd-resolved.service.


    systemd-resolve
             systemd-resolve --status                   tells what it knows
        sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
        sudo systemd-resolve --reset-server-features    equivalent to SIGRTMIN+1
        sudo systemd-resolve --interface --set-dns      sets dns for that interface
        sudo systemd-resolve --interface --revert       undoes prior command

        # On "my" default setup
        systemd-resolve --status
            My default setup, snipped
            Global
            Link 5 (enx58ef68e35d81) # This is eth0.  Ethernet thru USB adapter, hence the funny name.
                Current Scopes: DNS
                DNS Servers: 75.75.75.75        # comcast
                75.75.76.76        # comcast

     How to find out whose listening on DNS port:                                 
         sudo netstat -lnptu | grep ':53' # <snipped>
             tcp 0 127.0.0.53:53 733/systemd-resolve 
             udp 0 127.0.0.53:53 733/systemd-resolve 

VPN:
    This all started trying to bring a vpn with:
        netExtender --version
            NetExtender for Linux - Version 10.2.813
            SonicWall
            Copyright (c) 2020 SonicWall

    The problem is that routing comes up and works.
    DNS does not.  A *.local address can't be handled
    by stub resolver and I couldn't figure out a way
    to make systemd-resolve send *.local dns requests
    down the vpn.

    The --only-remote netExtender option should have solved it,
    but doesn't.

        I think the above has the answer, but it didn't work.
    One could also set the NetManager VPN Gui up, but I haven't gotten to that.
    As a workaround, I editted /etc/hosts


     Invoke by:
            netExtender vpn.vecnarobotics.com     \
            --username=<whatever>                 \
            --password=<whatever>                 \
            --domain=<whatever>                   \
            --auto-reconnect                      \
            --dns-XXX  # 3 choices
                --dns-prefer-remote Try remote DNS first, then try local DNS

                --dns-only-remote   Only use remote DNS servers
                                    Replaces /etc/resolv.conf with:
                                        nameserver 10.0.2.10
                                        nameserver 10.0.2.11

                --dns-prefer-remote Try remote DNS first, then try local DNS
                                    Same as --dns-only-remove but search: changed.

                --dns-only-local    Only use local DNS servers
                                    Don't touch /etc/resolv.conf
                


<todo> collect urls
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1068131/ubuntu-18-04-local-domain-dns-lookup-not-working
says that nameserver at localhost is refusing to lookup *.local

nmcli connection show --active to obtain active connection name
nmcli connection edit double tab to list available connections and chose appropriate

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1068131/ubuntu-18-04-local-domain-dns-lookup-not-working
I think the above has the answer.  Let's put back the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf the way
it was with DNS commented out.
