*** Stop asking for username/password.
On ubuntu 18.04 couldn't do anything that
required root access.  It asked for username/password
and I couldn't figure out how to enter it.  This fixed it.

edited /etc/cups/cupsd.conf:
Was:
    <Limit CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer CUPS-Delete-Printer CUPS-Add-Modify-Class CUPS-Delete-Class CUPS-Set-Default CUPS-Get-Devices>
    AuthType Default
    Require user @SYSTEM
    Order deny,allow
    </Limit>

Change to:
    <Limit CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer CUPS-Delete-Printer CUPS-Add-Modify-Class CUPS-Delete-Class CUPS-Set-Default CUPS-Get-Devices>
    AuthType None
    Order deny,allow
    </Limit>

# Make the server read it
sudo service cups restart
