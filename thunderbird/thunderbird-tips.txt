    MAIL XFER Between thunderbirds
    Address book XFER Between thunderbirds

thunderbird stores all it's data in:
    ~/.thunderbird/<random-number>.default/

**** MAIL XFER Between thunderbirds ********************************

Like most email programs, the mail is stored in a format incomprehesible to
any human being.  To move email from one machine to another, use an add-on:
    ImportOutputTools
    https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/mboximport-en.html

Download
install on via:
    "Tools" "Addons" "Install from local file"

Export: export folder with subfolders (with structure)
Import: "import mbox file" ; with its/their subdirectory.
        select the mbox file (NOT *.sbd directory)


**** Address book XFER Between thunderbirds ************************

Address books are stored in:
    *.mab files
Again incomprehensible to humans.

Mapping of file names is in
    ~/.thunderbird/<random-number>.default/
    pref.js
           has *.mab info
           don't edit manualy while running, will be overwritten
           Edit Preferences Config_Editor will let you edit it.

Again, an addon does the trick:
       MoreFunctionsForAddressBook
       https://freeshell.de//~kaosmos/morecols-en.html

Download
install on via:
    "Tools" "Addons" "Install from local file"
    restart

export: Address Book.<right click> "More Functions for AddressBook"
        Export as *.mab

import: Address Book.<right click> "More Functions for AddressBook"
        Import addressbook form *.mab file
