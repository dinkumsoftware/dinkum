KiCad
HOWTO print

2009-05-01  www.dinkumsoftware.com/tc  Initial
2009-05-06  www.dinkumsoftware.com/tc  upgrade to kicad 20090216-final

I created the original schematics as "B" (11x17) "ledger" size.


Here's one path that works.
	INITIAL: In KiCad: PLOT to postscript, with AUTO format, color


To get it printed on letter on LilBrother:
	Doesn't seem to work either directly or via envince.
        Didn't explore very much.

To get B size on HP5500 printer:
	lpr *.ps -P hp5500.wrc.DinkumSoftware.com
		--or--
	evince (default postscript viewer) will also print properly
	to hp5500.wrc.DinkumSoftware.com.  You might have to force tray 2,
	not sure about that.
			



Here's things that didn't work on older KiCad (one shipping with debian/ubuntu)
On limited test, didn't seem to work on KiCad 20090216-final, but didn't test hard.
    printing directly from KiCad
    almost all permutations of psresize, a2ps, gv, etc
