Best way is to have someone claim the meeting as the host (it can be
anyone).  To get set as the meeting host, click *Participants* and
then *Claim host* in the bottom right corner.  Next go to More and
select *Record* (depending on your zoom window, the *Record* button
may already be at the bottom of the screen).  I recommend *Record to
Computer* to save the recording to your local drive.  Once the meeting
has ended, the video will be converted to an mp4 and you'll have a
chance to select where on your local machine it saves to.  From there
you can upload it to the Google Drive Technology folder for
safekeeping and viewing.
