How to upgrade software on an embedded systems ts-7553-V2 to this century.

And for the elinux ones:

    I ended up doing a fresh build of Debian 12 using the distro-seed tooling to
    generate the image https://github.com/embeddedTS/distro-seed
        Itâ€™s pretty easy to use (just make sure your system is running >=python3.11)
        It originally did not support the TS-7553-V2 but they added it at my request :)
        My bet is that using the tool should be about as painless as getting a
        recent copy of our build over to you, with the benefit of no Seatrec IP complications.

        Cmd sequence I used:
            apt-get update && apt-get install -y qemu-user-static
            git clone https://github.com/embeddedTS/distro-seed.git
            cd distro-seed
            pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
            make checkdeps
            make ts7553v2_debian_12_headless_defconfig
            make
