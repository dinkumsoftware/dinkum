*** Overview of eclipse installation
This was done under ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Much easier:
     sudo snap install --classic eclipse
     sudo apt install default-jre


    This was done under ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS,
    but should apply to most linux systems

The eclipse installation is confusing to say the least.
Once installed it seems to work.  It has a myrid of
features (which is good), but make it confusing to
new user.

You can install os supplied packages using apt.
    I tried this and it failed.  Primarily (I think)
    because the 18.04.3 LTS is so old.
You can install from snap which under ubuntu is
    some kind of third party packing organization.
    Don't really understand it. Didn't try it
You can use eclipse oxygen installer
    No idea what this is and didn't try it.
You can download and install directly from eclipse
    This oddly enough is what eclipse recommends.
    This is what I did and it worked.

*** How to install eclipse:
    https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer

    eclipse.org/downloads
    download tools/eclipse/eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz

    Couldn't add eclipse icon to tool bar.  Fix via:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/1082340/how-to-add-eclipse-to-favorites
    Created ~/.local/share/applications/.desktop

    .bashrc: export PATH="$HOME/eclipse/java-2019-09/eclipse:$PATH"
       
*** Install PyDev
    Under ubuntu 20.04
    

    Under ubuntu 18.04
    This gets a python development environment and more importantly
    the only reasonable python debugger I could find.

    https://www.pydev.org/manual_101_root.html

    I configured pydev for python 3.6 as I wanted python 3.  Ubuntu 18.04 ships with
    both python 2 and 3, but python 2 is default.
    See http://www.pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html

    One can set up an eclipse/pydev project that runs from another source tree,
    i.e. one NOT under ..../eclipse.

    See https://www.pydev.org/manual_101_project_conf.html#CreatingaProjectfromexistingsources

*** Tweaks to eclipse/pydev

    .gitignore:
        add .project .pydevproject
    These are eclipse state files left in outside source tree.
    One could imagine putting them under git control, but I
    elected not to as they have local filesystem paths in them.

    eclipse: Turn on auto-refresh
         windows=>preferences check both "refresh on access" and "refresh using native hooks or polling"
    I do most of my code writing and early work in emacs.  I switch to eclipse when I need a debugger.
    This step makes the source files changed in emacs automagically show up in eclipse/pydev without
    hitting a refresh button.

    eclipse: switch to emacs-like keystrokes
        windows=>preferences=>general=>keys
        scheme: emacs
