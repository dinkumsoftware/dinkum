A short description of some useful git tools.

2019-11-22 tc Initial
2022-04-28 tc tried a few and made usability comments.

All of these install via apt [from ubuntu 18.04]

git-standup    command line tool to show synopis of last days
               git work.  Seemed to just work.  Time frame
               is programable.  Packaged for ubuntu
               instal: "snap install git-standup"

GUIs:
    A BUNCH more at: https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux

    gitk        Comes with git.  Lots of information displayed.  I've used it in
                the past and it works. 
    gitg        Lots of information displayed.  Packaged for ubuntu

    git-cola    Seemed intuitive in 5 minutes usage.  Includes
                git-dag. Packaged for ubuntu. uses gitk as visualizer
                mostly used to "do stuff" to git.  seems relatively
                user friendly. launch via git-cola &

    git-dag     git history viewer. Packaged for ubuntu
                seems pretty user friendly.
                launch via "git dag"

Cloud:
    gitlab has reasonable viewer.  "graph" button

    github couldn't find viewer in 5 minutes.
    Microsoft beginning to exert their influence of
    destroying good software.
