Trying to create:
    mv-git-repo  from to

Best answer from search:

Read the "git book"  Pro Git/Chacon about sub-projects.
As usual seem to be two approaches:
    create a submodule  ... lots of warts
    create a branch of src and somehow get it into main

don't fully understand how both work. <todo> look up read-tree

Probably next is think about what I really want/need to do.
Prototype it in a sandbox and then do it for real.
off to cheers
