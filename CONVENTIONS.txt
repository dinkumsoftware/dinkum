This is list of conventions followed in the dinkum repo (see above)

2019-04-30 tc Initial
2019-11-26 tc Added some python requirements
2019-12-07 tc Added some python unittest requirements
2020-10-02 tc Added more tests conventions
              Stayed with current flat approach

All executables start with dinkum- or dinkum_

Anything starting with tc- is NON-generic and are the author's desired customization.

documentation lives in ./doc directory
Cheatsheets are named: cheatsheet-<package-name>.[txt/pdf/etc]

package/subproject layout:
        dinkum/package/package/module.py
        dinkum/package/package/bin/dinkum_executable_code.py
            with sym-links of dinkum-executable-code => dinkum_executable_code.py
            in the dinkum/bin directory

Python unit testing:
    All non-bin *.py files will have unittest code
    at the END of the source file.

    class Test_<module_name>(unittest.TestCase):
    individual tests start with: test_
    Any required data lives in ./test_data

Executable testing:
    Test Programs for executables live in ./tests directory
    Other Test Programs can live their as well.
    A program that tests the "foo" executable, should be name "test-foo"
    Returns 0 if test passes and non-zero otherwise.

    Any test data is in ./test_data which is shared by unit tests.
