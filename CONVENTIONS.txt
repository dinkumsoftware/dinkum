CONVENTIONS.txt

This is list of conventions followed in the dinkum repo (see above)

2019-04-30 tc Initial
2019-11-26 tc Added some python requirements

All executables start with dinkum- or dinkum_

Anything starting with tc- is NON-generic and are the author's desired customization.

document lives in ./doc directory

<todo> rethink this... currently dinkum/package/package/module.py
                                 dinkum/package/package/bin/dinkum_executable_code.py
                                 with sym-links of dinkum-executable-code => dinkum_executable_code.py
                                      in both the bin directory AND dinkum/bin directory
       If I stay with below, consider python => python_src
       As I type this, I like the below better

All the python library source will be in:
    dinkum/python/dinkum/a/b/*.py    # In package library code
           python/bin/dinkum-*.py    # Is executable

    dinkum/bin ; sym links.e.g.
          dinkum-* ==> ../python/bin/dinkum-*.py

Python unit testing:
    All non-bin *.py files will have unittest code
    class Test_<module_name>(unittest.TestCase):
    individual tests start with: test_
    Any required data lives in ./test_data
