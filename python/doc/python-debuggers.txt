My answer:

I settled on eclipse and pydev.
[See dinkum/eclipse/doc/eclipse-install-and-setup-notes.txt]
Lots of overhead to get it setup, but seems to work well and
I couldn't find a better solution.


Here's some I considered but rejected:

winpdb      I used this in the past and it worked well.
            It is no longer maintained. The apt package
            that came with ubuntu 18.04 didn't work.
            There were various issues with python 2
            vs python 3

            Someone picked up winpdb's maintain and
            released it as winpdb-reborn:
            https://pypi.org/project/winpdb-reborn/

            Did a pip install.  It seems to generally
            work BUT local variables didn't show up.
            This is called "namespace not working" bug
            which mimics my symptons, but no answers.
            It Pointed to old original winpdb bug:
              https://sourceforge.net/p/winpdb/discussion/485189/thread/2689b421/

            Various version woes.  rpdb2.py needs set from ver <= 2.6.  I'm
            running ver 2.7 with no 2.6 on my system.

            Thought of half a dozen possible answers to these problems,
            but I gave up.

pud         command line debugger. 
            Packaged for ubuntu

pudb        "gui" using a curses-like terminal.
             I found it non-intuitive in 10 minutes usage.
             Probably works just fine. Packaged for ubuntu
