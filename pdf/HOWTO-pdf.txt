In trying to get mozilla to print my netledger invoices,
I ended up trying to downloading Adobe Acrobat.

There's a glob of PDF viewers around.
Make a list here in one place.

GnomeStart->Preferences->Files types ....
     gives *.pdf
           application/pdf
           and list of ggv,gv,xpdf
     

Gnome gives choice:
GNOME PDF Viewer
          GNOME PDF Viewer 0.110
          A PDF viewer based on Xpdf
          I assume it's built in
          ft:
    Decent Viewer
    Pages line up
    No printer
    No searching

ggv
         Gnome Ghostview 2.4.0.1
         The GNOME PostScript document previewer  
         rpm:ggv-2.4.0.1-1 /usr/bin/ggv 
    Decent viewer
    Printing works (via lpr, preferences let you print it elsewhere)
    



gv
        An X11 user interface for GhostScript
        gv 3.5.8 June 1997
        rpm:gv-3.5.8-23 /usr/X11R6/bin/gv
           not quite as nice as ggv
           similiar side menu to ggv
           old (support address us uwvax!tim HA)
           printing works

xpdf
        version 2.03
        rpm:xpdf-2.03-1 /usr/bin/xpdf
            weak user interface
            don't really like the fonts
            printing works
              



Looking at mozilla's configuration file:
~/.mozilla/pluginreq.dat
        34:application/pdf: PDF file: pdf:$
        35:application/x-pdf: PDF file: pdf:$
        36:text/pdf: PDF file: pdf:$
        37:text/x-pdf: PDF file: pdf:$
Don't know what it means

    If you want to display PDF documents inside of the browser window,
do the following: - Make sure that the Adobe Acrobat plugin (
nppdf32.dll) is in Mozilla's plugins directory. Then, open Acrobat
Reader and select "Edit" -> "Preferences". In the window that opens,
make sure that "Display PDF in browser" is checked.  If you do not
wish to display PDF documents inside of the browser window,
remove/delete the plugins and make sure that "Display PDF in browser"
is not checked.  For more information or if these instructions do not
work, check this thread) in Mozillazine's

      This thread is good.


ls -1 /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
   flashplayer.xpt@
   libflashplayer.so@
   mozplugger.so*
        rpm -qf /usr/lib/mozilla
        file /usr/lib/mozilla is not owned by any package ??????????

ls -1 /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4.1/plugins/
flashplayer.xpt@
libflashplayer.so@
libjavaplugin_oji.so@
libnullplugin.so*
        rpm -qf /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4.1/
            mozilla-1.4.1-18
            mozilla-mail-1.4.1-18



When I open file:..../*.pdf
It opens xfig in a browser window.

rtgrep'ed thru /usr/loib/mozilla-1.4.1 and no ascii file
contained xfig.  I can only guess it's built into the browser.
