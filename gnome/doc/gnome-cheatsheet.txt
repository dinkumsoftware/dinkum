How to keep gnome/nautilis to quit asking whether to
launch in terminal/display/cancel/run when you double-click an icon.

Thanks to:

To get /a/bin/foo to run:

Create a * foo.desktop somewhere:
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=foo
    Comment=It's not bar
    Exec=/a/bin/foo
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application

Now when you double-click, it runs (without a terminal)
