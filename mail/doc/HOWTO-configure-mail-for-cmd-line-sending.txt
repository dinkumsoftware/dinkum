Developed on ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, postfix 3.3.0

What it does:
    Sets up command line email for a non-primary machine.
    Assumes:
        a user REALUSER who gets their email as REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
        on a machine somewhere using remote SMTP/IMAP/POP server
        using a non-command line email client, e.g. thunderbird
            
        A non-primary machine : NPM.EXAMPLE.COM
          whose hostname may or may not be resolvable in dns.
                         may or may not have a valid reverse dns
                         may have a static or dhcp ip address
          Has a user                      : REALUSER
          Has other users (including root): OTHERUSER

    It installs a mail system such that:
        accepts no email from any network
        accepts internal email, i.e. from anyone at localhost
        forwards local email to root, REALUSER to: REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
        delivers other local email to local user.
        sends cmd-line email such that:
            mail from: REALUSER  appears from: REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
            mail from: OTHERUSER appears from: OTHERUSER@NPM.EXAMPLE.COM
            REALUSER email can be replied to, OTHERUSER email can not

# Install postfix
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mailutils

     # It asks some questions:
     # Accept the defaults

    General type of mail configuration:
        Internet Site
    Postfix Configuration:
        NPM.EXAMPLE.COM
        

# Watch the happenings, in another window:

# configure
sudo edit /etc/postfix/main.cf:
     # replace with:
     myhostname = NPM.EXAMPLE.COM

     # replace with:
     append_dot_mydomain = yes

     # replace with:
     myorigin = $myhostname  # mail comes from FQDN

     # replace with:
     inet_interfaces = loopback-only    # accept only local mail

     # add:
     sender_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_canonical

sudo systemctl restart postfix # kick the server

# Deliver local mail to REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
sudo edit /etc/aliases
     # All local addresses get sent elsewhere
     root     :  REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
     REALUSER :  REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
# rebuild db
sudo newaliases


# main from REALUSER appears as REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
sudo edit /etc/postfix/sender_canonical
    REALUSER  REALUSER@EXAMPLE.COM
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sender_canonical # Build the data base

# kick the server again to be sure
sudo systemctl restart postfix 

# test:
echo "body" | mail -s "subject" <whoever>    

# All done

NOTES:

    (1) If you need to ever return to re-adjust these settings,
    you can do so by typing:
        sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix
    But note that it will overwrite the manual changes
    you made to /etc/postfix/main.cf        

    (2) To start completely over:
        sudo apt purge mailutils postfix # Like apt remove, but removes config files as well.

    (3) To list all settings:
        postconf 

    (4) To see the version:
        postconf -d mail_version
