 Where does Evolution store my data?

Evolution stores your data in
          $HOME/.evolution/
your account settings in
     $HOME/.gconf/apps/evolution
and your passwords in (The passwords are not stored encrypted,
just base64 encoded.)
    $HOME/.gnome2_private/Evolution.


SSL Certificates are stored in
    $HOME/.camel_certs

and if Evolution crashed while you were writing an email, there could even be
a file
  $HOME/.evolution/.evolution-composer.autosave-123456
(where 123456 is some string)

Note: If you run Evolution 2.8 or older, the file will be at
$HOME/.evolution-composer.autosave-123456.

How does evolution store mail?
This was by reverse engineering the mail folders.

    For a mail folder named "foo"

    foo                  file   The mail in the folder
    foo.cmeta            file   
    foo.ibex.index       file
    foo.ibex.index.data  file
    foo.ev-summary       file   [optional] only present sometimes?
    foo.sbd              dir    [optional] Only if folder has subdirectories

    For every sub-folder of "foo", same files appear in foo.sbd

So  "export":
    shutdown evolution
    mv all those files to another directory
    it should work just fine.

Try it manually
