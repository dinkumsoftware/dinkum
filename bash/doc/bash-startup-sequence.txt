What files bash reads on startup/shutdown
Taken from Bash Reference Manual 6.2 Bash Startup Files
[ubuntu] file0 file1 means that stock ubuntu 20.04 reads file<n>

TOC:
    **STARTUP**            file(s) read on invocations
    **SHUTDOWN**           file(s) read on exist
    **WHERE TO PUT STUFF** an opinion on where to put startup code
    **See subdir bash_startup_test_file_snippets


**STARTUP**

* interactive login shell
                     invoked by:   1. login:  2. bash --login 3. su -l bash
  1. /etc/profile
        [ubuntu] a. diddle PS1
                 b. read /etc/bash.bashrc


  2. First of:
     a. ~/.bash_profile    [ubuntu] does not exist
     b. ~/.bash_login      [ubuntu] does not exist
     c. ~/.profile         [ubuntu] a. source ~/.bashrc
                                    b. add ~/bin        to PATH
                                    c. add ~/.local/bin to PATH

* interactive non-login shell
                        invoked by:  1) bash
  1. source ~/.bashrc


* non-interactively
                     invoked by:   1. foo.sh
  1. source $BASH_ENV                     


* remote shell daemon
                     invoked by:   1. ssh user@host

  1. source ~/.bashrc                     
          [ubuntu] by experiment, runs .profile which in term runs .bashrc
                   this must be done by sshd


* [Ubuntu] Gnome launched apps (by experiment)
                     invoked by:   1. icon
                                   2. gnome_terminal & # or whatever
   1. source ~/.profile
   2. source ~/.bashrc     from .profile

   but.... when gnome first starts (before any apps) the .bashrc doesn't
   get very far because it is being run non-interactively. So effectively
   just reads .profile.

   gnome-terminal/emacs read both .profile and .bashrc


* Others not covered in this document:
      invoked as sh, posix, unequal uid/gid


**SHUTDOWN**
                     invoked by: 1. interactive login shell exits
                                 2.  non-interactive login shell executes exit
  1. source ~/.bash_logout




**WHERE TO PUT STUFF**

If you are doing something that safely overwrites a prior invocation
(like setting an environment variable)
    put it .bashrc
that gets read by everything but a script invocation (EXPORT the
variable to pass it along)


If you are doing something that you don't want to do multiple times
per invocation (like adding something to PATH).
    put it in .profile

in principal one could do it in .bash_login or .bash_profile (and source'ing
.profile) but it fails under gnome as .bash_login doesn't appear to
be read.
 
**See subdir bash_startup_test_file_snippets for code to insert in various .xxx files
for test.
